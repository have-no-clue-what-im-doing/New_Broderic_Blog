Quick announcement here. I've changed the domain to this blog to: [broderic.blog](https://www.broderic.blog)

The old domain I was originally using I purchased off of google domains. Of course [Squarespace had to ruin that.](https://support.google.com/domains/answer/13689670?hl=en) I then went to Namecheap and purchased broderic.blog for only 5 dollars and sixteen cents for one year. Domain dealers are lame though, they'll give you a great deal when purchasing a new domain, but of course once it comes to renewal they will screw you over by jacking up the renewal price. Hopefully my renewal is no more than like $40.

In other news I also created another site: [film.broderic.blog](https://film.broderic.blog)

It's still a work in progress but the gist is that it'll be a super simple, no javascript, minimal website showcasing my film photography. 

I'm also going to try my best to start posting either weekly or bi weekly. We'll see how well that ages, but I want to make this blog more active. Not much is on here for being a nearly 2 year old blog.
