Hi I'm Broderic and I have no clue how to use computers. I created this site to learn how.

I recently graduated with a double major in Information Technology and Cybersecurity. I created this site for a couple reasons. The first being for me to have somewhere to write about and publish whatever I find interesting. And the second being I want to document any projects I'm working on. Documentation is a huge part of IT and I don't think it hurts to practice that skill every now and then.

#### Charity Place - IT Support Co-op 

*October 2021 - February 2022*

An entry level help desk support position where I did a little bit of everything. The company had around 70 employees in multiple locations. Some worked remote while others worked in person. There were 3 other IT employees. My manager, a network engineer, and a Salesforce specialist. Both the network engineer and Salesforce specialist worked remote. For the most part it was my manager and I doing most of the day to day IT support. My worked mostly involved the following: 



* Active Directory & Google Admin
	* Resetting passwords, adding and removing users
* CBTS
	* Configuring accounts 
	* Making sure phone numbers were being forwarded correctly
	* Connecting CBTS accounts to Webex
* Meraki
	* Configuring accounts
	* Resetting & setting up mobile devices 
* Miscellaneous troubleshooting for Windows, iOS and Android devices
	* A lot of non-routine problems where on the spot problem solving skills were required

#### University of Cincinnati Early IT Summer Camp - Teaching Assistant Intern

*June 2020*

I was assigned a group of 6 students to teach them the fundamentals of IT and help come up with and create a final project. Our project was a website about the many different areas of IT and how to start getting into the IT field. Since there was a pandemic going on the whole thing was remote. This made teaching a little difficult as it's pretty much impossible to see if students are paying attention. Luckily, most students participated and I was able to help walk them through creating a website from scratch using HTML and CSS.

#### CPR Cell Phone Repair - Repair Technician

*November 2018 - May 2019*

An independent cell phone repair shop, as the name suggests. I repaired iPhones, iPads, Androids, and laptops. I pretty much had to train myself on everything. My boss would hand me a phone and I'd just have to pull up a YouTube video to make sure I was doing the repair correctly. The job was definitely stressful at times. Not a fun experience performing a repair with no prior training. I honestly didn't know what I was doing half the time. The cherry on top was getting paid minimum wage. Never again.

## Interests & Goals

I'd say I am currently interested in the following areas:

* System Administration
	* Entra ID
	* Intune
	* Domain Controllers and Servers
	* Google Admin
	* Linux
* Cybersecurity
	* NetSec
	* Infrastructure Security
	* Web Application Security
	* Reverse Malware Engineer
	* DevOpsSec
* Networking & Infrastructure
* DevOps
* Cloud Computing
	* AWS
	* Azure
* Virtualization
	* ESXi (RIP, thanks Broadcom)
	* Proxmox
* Web Dev / Scripting
	* ReactJS
	* Python
	* Javascript
	* Bash
	* Powershell
* Digital Forensics

What I am not interested in:
* Printers
	* I hate these things with an absolute passion and want nothing to do with them. 

I'd say my current cert path is the following: 
* Security+ (2-4 weeks)
* CCNA (6-8 months)
* AWS-CCP (3-5 weeks)
* Azure Fundamentals (3-5 weeks)

The order isn't really set in stone. I do know I want to get the Security+ immediately after I graduate. Shouldn't be too hard of an exam to pass. I more open to whatever cert I think will help with my current job, or a job I want in the future.
