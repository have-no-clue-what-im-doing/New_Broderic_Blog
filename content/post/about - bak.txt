Hi I'm Broderic and I have no clue how to use computers. 

I'm currently pursuing a degree in IT with a focus on cybersecurity. I created this site for a couple reasons. The first being for me to have somewhere to write about and publish whatever I find interesting. And the second being I want to document any projects I'm working on. Documentation is a huge part of IT and I don't think it hurts to practice that skill every now and then.

## Previous IT Experience:

#### Charity Place - IT Support Co-op 

*October 2021 - February 2022*

An entry level help desk support position where I did a little bit of everything. The company had around 70 employees in multiple locations. Some worked remote while others worked in person. There were 3 other IT employees. My manager, a network engineer, and a Salesforce specialist. Both the network engineer and Salesforce specialist worked remote. For the most part it was my manager and I doing most of the day to day IT support. My worked mostly involved the following: 



* Active Directory & Google Admin
	* Resetting passwords, adding and removing users
* CBTS
	* Configuring accounts 
	* Making sure phone numbers were being forwarded correctly
	* Connecting CBTS accounts to Webex
* Meraki
	* Configuring accounts
	* Resetting & setting up mobile devices 
* Miscellaneous troubleshooting for Windows, iOS and Android devices
	* A lot of non-routine problems where on the spot problem solving skills were required

#### University of Cincinnati Early IT Summer Camp - Teaching Assistant Intern

*June 2020*

I was assigned a group of 6 students to teach them the fundamentals of IT and help come up with and create a final project. Our project was a website about the many different areas of IT and how to start getting into the IT field. Since there was a pandemic going on the whole thing was remote. This made teaching a little difficult as it's pretty much impossible to see if students are paying attention. Luckily, most students participated and I was able to help walk them through creating a website from scratch using HTML and CSS.

#### CPR Cell Phone Repair - Repair Technician

*November 2018 - May 2019*

An independent cell phone repair shop, as the name suggests. I repaired iPhones, iPads, Androids, and laptops. I pretty much had to train myself on everything. My boss would hand me a phone and I'd just have to pull up a YouTube video to make sure I was doing the repair correctly. The job was definitely stressful at times. Not a fun experience performing a repair with no prior training. I honestly didn't know what I was doing half the time. The cherry on top was getting paid minimum wage. Never again.

## Interests & Goals

My top interest is definitely cybersecurity. Specifically pentesting. The problem is I am nowhere near qualified to work as a professional pentester. The plan I've come up with focuses on three categories:

* Certifications
* Programming
* CTF

#### Certifications 

I want to work my way up to eventually obtaining the OSCP. The plan is to get these certs in this order:

* Security+
* Linux+
* CYSA+
* Pentest+
* OSCP

#### Programming

Think the most straightforward way of learning programming is to just program. Reading about programming can help, but it won't actually get me anywhere. Need to start with simple projects and then work my up to more complex projects. Also have to learn both low level languages and scripting languages. 

For Scripting:

* Python
* Javascript/Node.js
* Powershell
* Bash

And for low level:

* Assembly
* C
* C++

I think learning C & Python first should be a good starting point. Especially C. I can kind of learn all the scripting languages together, but I think it's important to make sure I have a good understanding of C before branching off into other low level languages. The reason being a lot of other languages are written in C, and Assembly is I think a little too low level to start out with.

#### CTF

Once I've become decent at working my way through a Linux terminal and can program a bit I'll start competing in CTF's. Start going on [ctftime.org](https://ctftime.org) and work my up from easy to more challenging competitions. Also wouldn't hurt to practice with [hackthebox](https://hackthebox.com) and [tryhackme](https://tryhackme.com) as well.
