      <description>&lt;p&gt;I originally found out about Hugo after browsing Hacker News (YCombinator) and coming across a blog with a footer containing a link to Hugo&amp;rsquo;s site. You can scroll to the bottom to get an exact example of what I&amp;rsquo;m talking about. If you click on the link you can see Hugo advertised as: &amp;ldquo;One of the most popular open-source static site generators.&amp;rdquo; Beforehand, I had been thinking about creating my own site and was researching what exactly I wanted to build my site with. Reading this I immediately bookmarked it. Hugo also claims to be the world&amp;rsquo;s fastest framework for building websites. Have no clue how true that is. Although Hugo is freakin fast once everything is set up. I specifically wanted to create my site as a blog and hugo seemed perfect for that. If you look at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://themes.gohugo.io&#34;&gt;themes&lt;/a&gt; for hugo it&amp;rsquo;s mostly just blogs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
