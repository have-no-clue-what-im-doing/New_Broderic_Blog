      <description>&lt;p&gt;AAJDSLKFJDSLKFJDSLKFJDSLKFDJSLKSFSJ&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A couple days ago I was mindlessly browsing the web when suddenly my internet went out. With it being 1am, it was a clear sign for me to go to bed, but I ignored it and just hopped on my phone for a bit. 30 minutes later I noticed the internet was still out and I was kinda pissed. (As if I was doing anything actually important.) Usually these outages only last about 10-15 minutes or so. I then decided to think more rationally and realized it was probably some maintenance upgrade since the outage started almost exactly at 1am. I was curious how long this outage would last and decided to create the greatest uptime script known to mankind:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
