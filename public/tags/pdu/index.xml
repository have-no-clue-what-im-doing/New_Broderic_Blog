      <description>&lt;p&gt;So I recently had fiber installed for our house. I have symmetric speeds now of 400 down and 400 up! Everything is great, except for one little mistake I made. With this new fiber installation, the ISP needed to install an ONT, and originally I was hoping they could possibly give me some kind of rack mountable ONT, but yeah, they don&amp;rsquo;t give that to residential customers. So the plan was to mount it to the wall behind the network rack. And when they asked me where exactly I wanted it mounted, I didn&amp;rsquo;t really think much of it, and said to put it right next to the power outlet.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
