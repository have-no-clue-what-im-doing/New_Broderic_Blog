      <description>&lt;p&gt;Quick announcement here. I&amp;rsquo;ve changed the domain to this blog to: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.broderic.blog&#34;&gt;broderic.blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The old domain I was originally using I purchased off of google domains. Of course &lt;a href=&#34;https://support.google.com/domains/answer/13689670?hl=en&#34;&gt;Squarespace had to ruin that.&lt;/a&gt; I then went to Namecheap and purchased broderic.blog for only 5 dollars and sixteen cents for one year. Domain dealers are lame though, they&amp;rsquo;ll give you a great deal when purchasing a new domain, but of course once it comes to renewal they will screw you over by jacking up the renewal price. Hopefully my renewal is no more than like $40.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Thoughts on Hugo</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I originally found out about Hugo after browsing Hacker News (YCombinator) and coming across a blog with a footer containing a link to Hugo&amp;rsquo;s site. You can scroll to the bottom to get an exact example of what I&amp;rsquo;m talking about. If you click on the link you can see Hugo advertised as: &amp;ldquo;One of the most popular open-source static site generators.&amp;rdquo; Beforehand, I had been thinking about creating my own site and was researching what exactly I wanted to build my site with. Reading this I immediately bookmarked it. Hugo also claims to be the world&amp;rsquo;s fastest framework for building websites. Have no clue how true that is. Although Hugo is freakin fast once everything is set up. I specifically wanted to create my site as a blog and hugo seemed perfect for that. If you look at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://themes.gohugo.io&#34;&gt;themes&lt;/a&gt; for hugo it&amp;rsquo;s mostly just blogs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
