      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;anki&#34;&gt;Anki&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Just recently Anki went through what&amp;rsquo;s probably the most drama it&amp;rsquo;ll ever experience. If you&amp;rsquo;ve never heard of &lt;a href=&#34;https://apps.ankiweb.net/&#34;&gt;Anki&lt;/a&gt;, it&amp;rsquo;s a free,  open source flashcard application that uses &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.ankiweb.net/background.html&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;active recall testing&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;spaced repetition&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, which allows for more efficient study and memorization. Anki was originally developed by Damien Elmes, who created Anki to help him learn Japanese. The word &amp;ldquo;Anki&amp;rdquo; comes from the pronunciation of the Japanese word for &amp;ldquo;memorize&amp;rdquo;. Anki is nearly 20 years old and over the decades has become extremely popular. With over 21K stars on Github and &lt;a href=&#34;https://forums.ankiweb.net/t/anki-downloads-statistics/28788/5&#34;&gt;at least 10M+ users on the Android app alone&lt;/a&gt;. This has led to some developers taking absolute advantage of its name and branding.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Quick announcement here. I&amp;rsquo;ve changed the domain to this blog to: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.broderic.blog&#34;&gt;broderic.blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The old domain I was originally using I purchased off of google domains. Of course &lt;a href=&#34;https://support.google.com/domains/answer/13689670?hl=en&#34;&gt;Squarespace had to ruin that.&lt;/a&gt; I then went to Namecheap and purchased broderic.blog for only 5 dollars and sixteen cents for one year. Domain dealers are lame though, they&amp;rsquo;ll give you a great deal when purchasing a new domain, but of course once it comes to renewal they will screw you over by jacking up the renewal price. Hopefully my renewal is no more than like $40.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Thoughts on Hugo</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I originally found out about Hugo after browsing Hacker News (YCombinator) and coming across a blog with a footer containing a link to Hugo&amp;rsquo;s site. You can scroll to the bottom to get an exact example of what I&amp;rsquo;m talking about. If you click on the link you can see Hugo advertised as: &amp;ldquo;One of the most popular open-source static site generators.&amp;rdquo; Beforehand, I had been thinking about creating my own site and was researching what exactly I wanted to build my site with. Reading this I immediately bookmarked it. Hugo also claims to be the world&amp;rsquo;s fastest framework for building websites. Have no clue how true that is. Although Hugo is freakin fast once everything is set up. I specifically wanted to create my site as a blog and hugo seemed perfect for that. If you look at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://themes.gohugo.io&#34;&gt;themes&lt;/a&gt; for hugo it&amp;rsquo;s mostly just blogs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
