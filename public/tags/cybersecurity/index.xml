      <description>&lt;p&gt;So I just recently passed the glorified vocab test known as the Security+. Just wanted to give me thoughts about. I studied for around a week and half. (Planned on 2 weeks, but got sick for around 4 days.) I do have a degree in cybersecurity, as well as having already taken and passed the Network+ 3 years prior. So that definitely helped.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I had planned on taking the Security+ much earlier, but once I got a fulltime job whilst still taking classes fulltime, I held off on it. I did however purchase Darril Gibson&amp;rsquo;s Security+ SY0-601 study guide before making this decision, so it ended up collecting dust for 2 years. Which is why I decided to go with the 601 exam instead of studying the newer 701 exam. I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like blowing money on another study guide.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
