With this new fiber installation, the ISP needed to install an ONT, and originally I was hoping they could possibly give me some kind of rack mountable ONT, but yeah, they don&rsquo;t give that to residential customers.

<p>You see what the issue is though? It shouldn&rsquo;t be directly plugged into the power outlet, it should plugged into my PDU, which is connected to my UPS. This set up is straight up stupid.</p>
<p><img src="//localhost:1313/small_brain/small_brain1.jpeg" alt="Small Brain"></p>
<p>And yeah I can&rsquo;t really just move the power cord over and plug it into the PDU. They literally gave me the smallest power cord in existence. So I&rsquo;m going to have to remount this thing closer to where the PDU is. Really wish I could&rsquo;ve just gotten a rack mounted ONT :(</p>
