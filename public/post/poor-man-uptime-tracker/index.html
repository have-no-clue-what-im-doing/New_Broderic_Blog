A couple days ago I was mindlessly browsing the web when suddenly my internet went out. With it being 1am, it was a clear sign for me to go to bed, but I ignored it and just hopped on my phone for a bit. 30 minutes later I noticed the internet was still out and I was kinda pissed. (As if I was doing anything actually important.) Usually these outages only last about 10-15 minutes or so. I then decided to think more rationally and realized it was probably some maintenance upgrade since the outage started almost exactly at 1am. I was curious how long this outage would last and decided to create the greatest uptime script known to mankind:">

    <div class="content"><p>AAJDSLKFJDSLKFJDSLKFJDSLKFDJSLKSFSJ</p>
<p>A couple days ago I was mindlessly browsing the web when suddenly my internet went out. With it being 1am, it was a clear sign for me to go to bed, but I ignored it and just hopped on my phone for a bit. 30 minutes later I noticed the internet was still out and I was kinda pissed. (As if I was doing anything actually important.) Usually these outages only last about 10-15 minutes or so. I then decided to think more rationally and realized it was probably some maintenance upgrade since the outage started almost exactly at 1am. I was curious how long this outage would last and decided to create the greatest uptime script known to mankind:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>@echo off

:internet
ping 8.8.8.8 -n 1 | find &#34;Reply&#34; &gt;&gt; gimmeINTERNET!.txt
echo %time% &gt;&gt; gimmeINTERNET!.txt
goto internet
</code></pre><p>Forget Uptime Kemu, this batch script is clearly better and much more sophisticated.</p>
<p>The next morning I woke up to this master piece:</p>
<p><img src="//localhost:1313/poor_man_uptime/uptime.png" alt="Finally getting replies back at 7:35am"></p>
<p>Through my genius and ingenuity I was able to figure out that the network went back online at 7:35am. After doing some heavy calculations for a couple hours, I figured out that the maintenance took roughly 6 hours and 30 minutes. All that maintenance and my internet speed is still shit, pathetic.</p>
