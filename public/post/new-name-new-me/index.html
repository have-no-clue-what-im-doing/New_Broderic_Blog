<p>The old domain I was originally using I purchased off of google domains. Of course <a href="https://support.google.com/domains/answer/13689670?hl=en">Squarespace had to ruin that.</a> I then went to Namecheap and purchased broderic.blog for only 5 dollars and sixteen cents for one year.

<p>In other news I also created another site: <a href="https://film.broderic.blog">film.broderic.blog</a></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still a work in progress but the gist is that it&rsquo;ll be a super simple, no javascript, minimal website showcasing my film photography.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also going to try my best to start posting either weekly or bi weekly. We&rsquo;ll see how well that ages, but I want to make this blog more active. Not much is on here for being a nearly 2 year old blog.</p>
